# Ajo Savings Tracker 🇳🇬

A modern, high-aesthetic web application for managing traditional rotating thrift associations (**Ajo** / ROSCA) across Nigeria.

---

## Problem Context

In Nigeria, traditional thrift groups (*Ajo*) are a vital financial lifeline for market traders, artisans, small business owners, and staff cooperatives. Members contribute a fixed amount of money (e.g. ₦25,000 to ₦200,000) into a shared pool at regular intervals (weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly). In each cycle, one member receives the full lump-sum payout (*takes the hand* or *collects the pot*).

### Manual Challenges Solved:
- **Paper Notebook Errors**: Eliminates lost ledger books and dispute-prone manual record-keeping.
- **Lack of Transparency**: Real-time visibility into who has paid, whose payment is pending verification, and who is overdue.
- **Rotation Queue Conflicts**: Clear visual turn schedules with member position swapping for urgent financial needs (e.g., bulk stock inventory, school fees).
- **Payment Verification Proof**: Digital receipt generation tailored for Nigerian payment channels (Moniepoint, OPay, Zenith, First Bank, Cash).
